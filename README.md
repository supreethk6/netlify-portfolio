### ![Knightscope](logos/Knightscope_Render.png) Knightscope, Mountain View

#### Sr. Robotics Software Engineer
- AUG 2019 - PRESENT
- Lead the Knightscope’s (KI) Autonomous Data Machine (ADM) Core team to work on a Research and Development project. This project helps Knightscope in improving overall robot navigation and reduction in operational and service cost with a newer K5 robot body and sensors.
- Designing and prototyping the sensors, navigation stack, state machine and other components; keeping robustness and easy serviceability of the KI robots in mind. 
- Implement the Park feature especially for snowy areas (harsh weather) so the robot could stay docked to the charging station by varying its voltage, current and temperature. This feature reduced the operation cost by over 10%.
- Autonomously detect a charging dock using robot camera and lidars, and safely dock
into it to charge indoor robots, reducing operating costs by over 15%.
- Capture of error state, and it’s analytics to determine fault-prone areas to robots,
and add situation avoidance for reproducible error states to mitigate such incidents. 
- Observe human-robot interaction to develop tools that help engineers map custom
patrol paths for robots, reducing robot deployment time by more than 35%.
- Create custom robot visualizer panels, and set up remote control capabilities to assist network operating engineers in transmitting changes to robot configuration over the air;
so they can adapt robots to function optimally in its local environment.
- Lead, and managed a small team of remote robotic engineers to create analytics and system data collection tools. These tools help in graphing robot failure modes and improve the quality of the robot fleet aimed at reducing operational, and service cost.
